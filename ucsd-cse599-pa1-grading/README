# Grader for autograder-demo

src/
  JSONRunner.java
  
    This file runs the test suite in cse599pa1student.MethodTest and prints the
    results in JSON format to standard out. 

pa1tests/MethodTest.java

  The tests that we run on 4 student methods.

grade

  The entrypoint for the grader (called from run_autograder)

grade.py

  This is where the real action happens. 

  The idea here is to check for correct files and directory structure submitted,
  compile the student code and our tests, copy our tests into the student directory,
  then run JSONRunner with the classpath set to that directory.

  JSONRunner will emit the results for each of the tests in
  JSON, and then grade.py attributes points for each test
  (pass or fail) and generates the final report.
